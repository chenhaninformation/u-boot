U-boot for ESPRESSObin
======================

This branch of U-boot is for ESPRESSObin board and it is based on
[Marvell U-boot][Marvell U-boot] branch
[u-boot-2017.03-armada-17.10][u-boot-2017.03-armada-17.10].

We only provide the build steps and some notes. You can find documentation at
both the mainline of [U-boot] and most recent release of
[Marvell U-boot][Marvell U-boot].

Note
====

ESPRESSObin Boot Mode
---------------------

ESPRESSObin have a BOOT ROM on chip, which will support the SoC boot from
different devices by setting up the three jumper descripted
[here][Build From Source - Bootloader].

Here is a brief table shown the first boot devices controled by those three
jumpers:

| ESPRESSObin boot mode           |  J10  |  J3   |  J11  |
| :------------------------------ | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Serial NOR Flash Download Mode  |  1-2  |  2-3  |  2-3  |
| eMMC Download Mode              |  2-3  |  1-2  |  2-3  |
| eMMC Alternate Download Mode    |  1-2  |  1-2  |  2-3  |
| SATA Download Mode              |  2-3  |  2-3  |  1-2  |
| Serial NAND Flash Download Mode |  1-2  |  2-3  |  1-2  |
| UART Mode                       |  2-3  |  1-2  |  1-2  |

Boot requirement
----------------

This U-boot compiled output binary shoud (MUST?) wrapper by the
[ATF (ARM Trusted Firmware)][ATF (ARM Trusted Firmware)] in order to boot.

After carefully tested, we find that only [Marvell U-boot] branch
[u-boot-2017.03-armada-17.10] wrappered by [Marvell ATF] branch
[atf-v1.3-armada-17.10] can boot normally without crash the system.

In order to **reduce workload**, we decide to working on those two old
branches rather than fix booting issue by using the most recent release of
U-boot and ATF.

Using the branches above is just a beginning, compile the U-boot with Ubuntu
18.04 default gcc (gcc version 7) will cause the U-boot to access the memory
region reserved by ATF. By carefully tested, **compile the U-boot with gcc-5
can solve the problem**.

***WARNING***: Tested ONLY using Linaro release gcc with version of gcc-5.2
and gcc-5.5. The original gcc-5 was never tested. Tested compiler can be find
[here][Build From Source - Toolchain].

Build Step
==========

Config U-boot
-------------

Some of the CONFIG\_\* is **NOT** generated by Kbuild system, but in the
[configs include directory][configs include directory], and the build process
will include those files in order to finish the build process.

During build process, file [mvebu\_armada-37xx.h][mvebu_armada-37xx.h]
will be included, which will include another file
[mvebu\_armada-common.h][mvebu_armada-common.h], they both will merged into
**.config** file. Some configs will not be configured via Kbuild, you should
edit [mvebu\_armada-common.h][mvebu_armada-common.h] manually in order to
config the build behaviour.

Boot device need be specified during build process, and it can be selected
via Kbuild process:

```
Command line interface -->
    Misc commands -->
        MVEBU commands -->
            Flash for image -->
                SPI flash boot (CONFIG_MVEBU_SPI_BOOT)
                eMMC flash boot (CONFIG_MVEBU_MMC_BOOT)
```

After config the boot device, more configs are selected in file
[mvebu\_armada-common.h][mvebu_armada-common.h] by those two CONFIG\_\*,
including where to store the u-boot environment.

The default boot device is boot from SPI NOR flash, the SPI flash layout
may look like this:
```
-----------------------------------------------------------------
|               U-boot Image                    |   U-boot ENV  |
-----------------------------------------------------------------
0x0                                             0x3f0000        0x400000
```

Where the 0x400000 is the size of the SPI NOR flash, which set default as 4M
byte.

Build U-boot
------------

Normal compile step are shown in follow:
```
1. export CROSS_COMPILE=/path/to/aarch64/compiler
2. make defconfig
3. make
```

While in our case, we need download or install gcc-5 instead of using the
default conpiler from Debian/Ubuntu.

**Note**: Put the $PATH at the end of the sentence, make sure we cover the
default finding path /usr/bin.
```
1. export PATH=/path/to/linaro-gcc-5/bin:$PATH
2. export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
3. make mvebu_espressobin-88f3720_defconfig # espressobin default config file
4. make DEVICE_TREE=armada-3720-espressobin
```

Then you will see a **u-boot.bin** came out at the top directory of U-boot.
Any fether reading of how to compile the U-boot of ESPRESSObin board, please
refer to [here][Build From Source - Bootloader].

After Build
===========

As mentioned above, one single **u-boot.bin** can not boot the board, the
output of U-boot **u-boot.bin** should (MUST?) be wrapper by
ARM-Trusted-Firmware.

How to wrapper **u-boot.bin** using ATF? please follow the build instruction
at [ChenHan ATF][ChenHan ATF] branch
[atf-v1.3-armada-17.10-ch-dev][atf-v1.3-armada-17.10-ch-dev].

The README.md file have some information you may needed.
